   [SIR JOHN _and_ LADY CAROLINE PONTEFRACT, MISS WORSLEY, _on chairs underlarge yew tree_.]</p>

<h5 class="LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE</h5>  
<p id="speech"> I believe this is the first English country house you have stayed at, Miss Worsley? </p>

<h5 class="HESTER">HESTER</h5>  
<p id="speech">Yes, Lady Caroline.</p>

<h5 class="LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE</h5>  
<p id="speech"> You have no country houses, I am told, in America? </p>

<h5 class="LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE</h5>

charming place than this, Miss Worsley, though the house is excessively
damp, quite unpardonably damp, and dear Lady Hunstanton is sometimes a
little lax about the people she asks down here. </p><p id="StageDirection"> [_To_ SIR JOHN.]</p><p id="speech"> Jane
mixes too much.  Lord Illingworth, of course, is a man of high
distinction.  It is a privilege to meet him.  And that member of
Parliament, Mr. Kettle—</p>
